Podcast AR is a platform that helps podcasters become closer to their users through augmented reality experiences.


A podcaster who owns a podcast that is available on spotify can create a podcast in our system and attach certain media (images) to certain timestamps within the podcast. Users will then be able to open our app, select a podcast, and as they listen, images will show up on the screen at the specified timestamps. The user also has the ability to control spotify (play, pause, skip).


This is a v1 product meant to show the usefulness of a platform like this. We want to expand and create a UI for podcasters to add and modify different types of media besides just images to their podcast in an effort to give podcasters more ways to be closer to their listeners.


If you want to use the app. Please sign up and link your spotify at tinyurl.com/PodcastAR99

NOTE: you must have spotify premium to use this app.

Once you clone the repository, note that testing in lens studio will not work due to the fact that the snap api returns the snap username as snapUser if you are not running the app on the glasses. If you want to test on lens studio, go to the PodcastListGenerator.ts script and change the username variable in line 12 to your snap username.
